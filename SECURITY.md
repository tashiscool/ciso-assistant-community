# Security Policy

Cyber Security is very important to us.

## Supported Versions

We typically and primarily support the latest releases of our products for maintenance updates, but depending on the nature of the security issue we may issue hotfixes for arbitrarily earlier versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by opening a [security advisory](https://github.com/tashiscool/ciso-assistant-community/security/advisories/new) and not by creating a public GitHub issue. We'll get back to you ASAP and work with you to confirm and plan a fix for the issue.

Please note that we do not currently offer a bug bounty program.
